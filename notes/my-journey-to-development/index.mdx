Hola. üëãüèæ

Over the course of my life I've considered a few different career paths. A few others I was told I'd be good at, but I never pursued. Ultimately, I wound up graduating from [THEE Jackson State University](https://www.jsums.edu/) with my B.A. in Graphic Design and a Minor in Marketing. A few years later I also graduated with my M.F.A. in Media Design from [FullSail University](https://www.fullsail.edu/). Although I was doing freelance work in branding and photography, while working full time as a Technical Support Technician, a salaried career in the design industry was still eluding me.

So I decided to quit my job and pursue design. After taking a self imposed sabbatical. üòÇ During this time I began to rethink my career path though. Surprise, surprise. I had taken a Computer Aided Design class in undergrad and enjoyed it. Plus, I'd done some stuff on CodeCademy and Treehouse off and on for years. After looking at the career projections for a Software Engineer, I was sold. How best to transition though?

While I could go the self taught road, I figured that that I should probably go with a more structured approach. I began looking up coding bootcamps and happened upon an event being held by [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) in my city. I thought it was about building a Twitter bot, but turns out that event was for another day. The one I ended up attending was about attending Thinkful. So I got a breakdown of what their Engineering Immersion program was about, the community and payment options. I was all but sold at that point. A few weeks later I applied.

Truth be told, I failed the entrance exam my first time around. I can say it was because I was on vacation. Or nerves. Or whatever. But I failed it and it felt miserable. I completely blanked. Fortunately, I was able to take the exam again and that time I passed. üôåüèæ Praise God.

I began my program January 2018. My graduate program was 100% remote so I wasn't completely a stranger to online school, but my experience was even better than I would have imagined. I loved having a dedicated mentor that I met with twice a week, the pair programming and the Q&A sessions. There was someone available to help answer a question nearly all hours of the day because there were mentors world wide and in different time zones. Building a few apps as we went through the program also helped to solidify concepts while learning how to work by ourselves, with another dev and finally as a team.

The career development program after graduating kept me on my toes about applying, but it was still a hard process. Many people mentioned they could see my potential and that I'd be a good culture fit. They were hesitant though about my lack of experience. Sometimes I don't even understand why "entry level" jobs are a thing because companies don't actually want to take the chance on an entry level candidate. I digress though.

I had a few interviews over the 6 months after "graduation" and then ended up getting interviewed without even knowing it. I was at a whiteboarding event being held by [LEARN Academy](https://www.learnacademy.org/) and this gentleman, Matt, came over to talk to me about my code. He liked what I was doing. The next day, I had an email from him asking what my career goals were and if I'd like to talk. I didn't think anything of it because I had no idea who this guy was. We had a few conversations and he had me come in to meet his business parter, Rob. Turns out that Rob and Matt were co-founders of a dev agency. Even still I had no thoughts. In retrospect that was probably best because I wasn't nervous. Wasn't trying to give my elevator pitch or recall code syntax and best practices from memory. I was just having conversations. A couple of weeks later, I had a job offer.

That was almost three years ago. I've been blessed to work with an amazing group of people at [Notch8](https://www.notch8.com/) on some dope React, React Native and Rails codebases. I've grown as a developer and person. Needless to say, I don't think I'll be career switching again. Lol.

Software development isn't for everyone. If you're thinking about becoming a software developer though, give it a shot. Do your research first of course and see if you have the aptitude and desire for it. It's challenging and rewarding at the same time. Every day there's a new problem to solve. But that's part of the beauty of it all. If you start succumbing to imposter syndrome, check out my [blog post](/imposter-syndrome/) about that too.

If you'd like to chat personally, you can send me an email or reach out at any of my listed social handles.

See you next time. üôÉ
