blurb: How do you use hooks and where did my lifecycle methods go ??

Recently I was asked to give a presentation on how to convert class components in a React Native app, into functional ones. There's a lot that can be said, but over the next 4 weeks I plan to discuss the 4 areas that I feel are pretty crucial to getting this done. The examples I'll be showing are kept at the bare minimum to demostrate the point, without providing a lot of unneccesary information.

## Declaring the function and props
- Functional components no longer need the `Component` React import
- While I prefer using arrow functions for const declarations, it's not mandatory
- You can destructure props in the argument, or just pass in `props` 
- Remove the render and enclosing curly braces
- Destructuring the props in the argument means I don't need a return block

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { Button, View } from 'react-native'

class Form extends Component {
    render() {
        const { submitText } = this.props

        return (
            <View>
                <Button text={submitText} />
            </View>
        )
    }
}

export default Form
```

import { Button, View } from 'react-native'

const Form = ({ submitText }) => (
    <View>
        <Button text={submitText}/>
    </View>
)







export default Form
