Hola. :wave:

Below is an example of a React class component that I converted into a React functional component in a React Native app a few weeks ago. Whether it's a React app or React Native app though, the principles would have been the same.

For some the below may be enough to go off and convert classes yourself. For anyone who would appreciate a more guided approach though, I'll be breaking down the pieces over the next few posts.
- Declaring the function and props
- Removing the constructor
- Converting common lifecycle methods
- Converting helper functions

### Class
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { Button, TextInput, View } from 'react-native'

class Form extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.state = { name: '' }
        this.nameRef = React.createRef()
    }

	onChange = field => value => this.setState({ [field]: value })

    render() {
		const { submitText } = this.props

        return (
            <View>
                <TextInput
                    value={name}
                    ref={this.nameRef}
                    onChangeText={this.onChange('name')}
                />
            </View>
			<Button text={submitText}/>
        )
    }
}

export default Form
```

### Function

```js
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { Button, TextInput, View } from 'react-native'

const Form = ({ submitText }) => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('')
    const nameRef = useRef()

    return (
        <View>
            <TextInput
                value={name}
                ref={nameRef}
                onChangeText={name => setName(name)}
            />
			<Button text={submitText}/>
        </View>
    )
}

export default Form
```

See you next time. :upside_down_face:
